COMMENT - During some types of the C4 photosynthetic carbon assimilation cycle, the initial CO<sub>2</sub> fixation occurs in the mesophyll cells, producing |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID| that is subsequently converted to |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE|. L-aspartate is transported into bundle sheath cells, where it is converted to |FRAME: MAL|, followed by the release of CO<sub>2</sub> from malate. This reaction aims to describe the transport of |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| from the mesophyll cells to the bundle sheath cells.
