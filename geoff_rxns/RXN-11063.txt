COMMENT - The exact reaction or series of reactions leading to the formation of |FRAME: CPD-12006| remain to be elucidated. It is possible that a series of reactions involving first a |FRAME: CPD-13774| intermediate and then a methaneseleniol intermediate are required, similar to the enzymatic steps observed for dimethyldisulfide biosynthesis |CITS: [16307305]|.
