COMMENT - The key step of the jadomycin biosynthesis is the oxidative opening of the 5,6-bond of an angucyclinone intermediate, which likely leads to the formation of an aldehyde that can easily react with the amino acid isoleucine, thereby forming an aldimine.
/This amino acid incorporation can be either an enzyme-catalyzed or a spontaneous reaction. However, the product has been shown to be a mixture of 5-diastereomers, supporting a nonenzymatic reaction. In addition, when other amino acids were provided in excess, it was shown that they are incorporated into the jadomycin skeleton, further supporting this assumption |CITS: [15070349]|.
