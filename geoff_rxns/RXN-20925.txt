COMMENT - Not much is known about the degradation of |FRAME: CPD-4841|. A 1990 study has shown that the compound can be transformed by aerobic marine bacteria to |FRAME: CPD-22553|, which was then photolyzed with a half-life of 100 minutes. The details of this degradation process are not known |CITS: [16348188]|.
