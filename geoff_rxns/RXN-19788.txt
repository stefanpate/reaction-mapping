COMMENT - A heme-thiolate protein (P-450). The enzyme from the plant |FRAME: TAX-35626| also hydroxylates valencene at C-2 to give the &alpha;-hydroxy compound, nootkatol, and this is converted into nootkatone. 5-Epiaristolochene and epieremophilene are hydroxylated at C-2 to give a 2&beta;-hydroxy derivative which is not further oxidized.
