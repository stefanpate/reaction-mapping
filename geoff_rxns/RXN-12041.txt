COMMENT - The enzyme is involved in biosynthesis of 2-(&alpha;-D-glucopyranosyl)-D-glycerate via the two-step pathway in which glucosyl-3-phosphoglycerate synthase catalyses the conversion of |FRAME: GDP-D-GLUCOSE| and |FRAME: G3P| into |FRAME: CPD-9189|, which is then converted to |FRAME: CPD-9190| by (|FRAME: RXN-8852 "EC 3.1.3.-"|), glucosyl-3-phosphoglycerate phosphatase. The activity is dependent on divalent cations (Mn2+, Co2+, or Mg2+). The enzyme from |FRAME: TAX-309805| shows moderate flexibility on the sugar donor concerning the nucleotide moiety (UDP-glucose, ADP-glucose, GDP-glucose) but is strictly specific for glucose. The enzyme is also strictly specific for 3-phospho-D-glycerate as acceptor |CITS: [17189358]|. The enzyme from |FRAME: TAX-29291| is strictly specific for GDP-glucose and 3-phospho-D-glycerate |CITS: [16428406]|. This enzyme catalyses the first glucosylation step in methylglucose lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis in mycobacteria |CITS: [19015727][19052364]|.
