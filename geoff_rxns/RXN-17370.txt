COMMENT - Even though this reaction appears like an epimerization reaction, it is actually a spontaneous tautomerization, resulting from the shifting of the double bond between the hydroxyl groups at positions 1 and 3, with concomitant shifting of the double bond within the ring |CITS: [25965179]|.
