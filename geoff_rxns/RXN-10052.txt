COMMENT - Acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) are produced by a number of bacterial species and are used by them to regulate the
/expression of virulence genes in a process known as quorum-sensing.
/Each bacterial cell has a basal level of AHL and, once the population density reaches a critical level, it triggers
/AHL-signaling which, in turn, initiates the expression of particular virulence genes.
/Plants or animals capable of degrading AHLs would have a therapeutic advantage in avoiding bacterial infection as
/they could prevent AHL signaling and the expression of virulence genes in quorum-sensing bacteria.
/ N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone, N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L homoserine lactone, N-butanoyl-L-homoserine lactone
/and N-(3-oxooctanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone can act as substrates.
