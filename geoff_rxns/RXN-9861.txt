COMMENT - The conversion of |FRAME: 2-CL-MUCONATE| to |FRAME: CPD-10639| was demonstrated using purified chloromuconate
/cycloisomerase enzymes |CITS: [7751312]|. However, it is assumed that the later is not the product of the enzyme in vivo.
/Rather, any |FRAME: CPD-10639| should be converted back to |FRAME: 2-CL-MUCONATE|, and then converted by
/the same enzyme to |FRAME: CPD-10638|, which is substrate for chloride elimination, still catalyzed by the same enzyme.
/The final product, |FRAME: CPD-10608|, is degraded further by a hydrolase.
