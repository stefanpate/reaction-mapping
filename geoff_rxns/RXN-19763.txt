COMMENT - This reaction describes endo-hydrolysis of a polymeric compound. The substrate should be shown as (1,4-&beta;-D-galactosyl)<sub>(n+m)</sub>, while the two products should be (1,4-&beta;-D-galactosyl)<sub>n</sub> and (1,4-&beta;-D-galactosyl)<sub>m</sub>, respectively. These coefficients are not displayed properly due to limitations in the software.
