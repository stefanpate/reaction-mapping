COMMENT - This transformation is described as the reaction catalyzed by the bzaE enzyme of |FRAME: TAX-1736|. Full details about the reaction, which is not balanced, were not provided |CITS: [26246619]|.
/
/It should be noted that a biochemical transformation of this type usually requires more than one enzyme. For example, it may be composed of a hydroxylation accompanied by the release of methanol and CO<sub>2</sub> (see for example |FRAME: EC-3.1.1.82|) followed by methylation.
