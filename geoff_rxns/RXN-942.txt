COMMENT - The formation of (3-methylbenzyl)succinate from meta-xylene and fumarate appears to be the initial reaction in anaerobic meta-xylene degradation.  
/This type of fumarate addition reaction appears to be a novel way for activating methylbenzenes in the absence of molecular oxygen. as it has been demonstrated to be the initial reaction in anaerobic toluene degradation  |CITS: [9006019][8706665]|  and has been implicated as the initial step in meta-cresol |CITS: [10550470]| and para-cresol  |CITS: [11133971]| degradation.
