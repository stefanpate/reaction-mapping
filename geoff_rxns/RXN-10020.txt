COMMENT - Acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) are produced by a number of bacterial species and are used by them to regulate the expression of virulence genes in a process known as quorum-sensing.  Each bacterial cell has a basal level of AHL and, once the population density reaches a critical level, it triggers AHL-signaling which, in turn, initiates the expression of particular virulence genes.  N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-[acyl-carrier-protein] and hexanoyl-[acyl-carrier protein] are the best substrates.  The fatty-acyl substrate is derived from fatty-acid biosynthesis through acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] rather than from fatty-acid degradation through acyl-CoA.  S-adenosyl-L-methionine cannot be replaced by methionine, S-adenosylhomocysteine, homoserine or homoserine lactone.
