COMMENT - |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| is formed by |FRAME: EC-2.5.1.6| and bears an <i>S</i> configuration at the sulfur atom. The chiral sulfonium of AdoMet spontaneously racemizes to form a mixture of <i>S</i> and <i>R</i> isomers of AdoMet under physiological conditions, reducing its activity, as the R isomer is not accepted as a substrate for AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases |CITS: [12419350]|.
