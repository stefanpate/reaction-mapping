COMMON-NAME - fatty acid elongation
CANNOT-BALANCE? - T
COMMENT - The substrate, fatty acyl-CoA is at least 18-carbons (C18) in length. The product, very long chain fatty acyl-CoA is longer than C18 in length and up to C32 in length.  The reaction adds a C2 to the substrate and extends its length by 2 carbons each reaction.  Different fatty acid elongases have different substrate specificities, i.e. they catalyze substrates having different carbon chain length  and different degrees of saturation |CITS: [10330468]|.
