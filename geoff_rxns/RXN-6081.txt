COMMENT - This is a chemical, non-enzymatic reaction, that happens under aerobic conditions.
/However, there are some indications that there may be an enzyme that catalyzes the reaction. Heat treatment of
/crude extracts from <i>Leuconostoc lactis</i> cells reduced the rate of diacetyl formation from 2-acetolactate (ALA)
/|CITS: [11164316]| . A second study found that non-enzymatic decarboxylation does not fully explain the quantities of
/diacetyl produced by |FRAME: CPLX-5261|-defficient mutants of this strain |CITS: [Aymes99]|, 
/and yet a third study found that there was a thermolabile component in the decarboxylation of ALA
/|CITS: [Rondags98]|.
