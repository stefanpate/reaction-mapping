COMMENT - Involved in the monoterpene degradation pathway of the actinomycete Rhodococcus erythropolis.
/
/The enzyme hydrolyzes several alicyclic and 1-methyl-substituted epoxides, such as 1-methylcyclohexene oxide, indene oxide and cyclohexene oxide.
/
/It differs from the previously described epoxide hydrolases (EC 3.3.2.3, EC 3.3.2.4, EC 3.3.2.6, and EC 3.3.2.7) as it is not inhibited by 2-bromo-4'-nitroacetophenone, diethyl pyrocarbonate, 4-fluorochalcone oxide or 1,10-phenanthroline.
