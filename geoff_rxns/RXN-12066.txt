COMMENT - A heme-thiolate protein (P-450). This enzyme catalyses two successive N-hydroxylations of L-phenylalanine, the first committed steps in the biosynthesis of benzylglucosinolate. The product of the two hydroxylations, N,N-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine, is extremely labile and dehydrates spontaneously.The dehydrated product is then subject to a decarboxylation that produces the oxime. It is still not known whether the decarboxylation is spontaneous or catalysed by the enzyme. The product, (E)-phenylacetaldoxime, undergoes a spontaneous isomerization to the (Z) form.
