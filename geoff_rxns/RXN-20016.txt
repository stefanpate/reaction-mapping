COMMENT - In this reaction the DsbC disulfide isomerase acts to reduce a periplasmic protein that contains incorrect disulfide bonds; the product of the reaction 'a protein with reduced sulfide groups' then becomes available as a substrate for the thiol:disulfide oxidoreductase |FRAME: MONOMER0-4152 "DsbA"|.
