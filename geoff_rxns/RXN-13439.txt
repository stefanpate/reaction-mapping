COMMENT - Both this enzyme and EC 6.3.2.30 are required for the elongation of cyanophycin, which is a protein-like cell inclusion that is unique to cyanobacteria and acts as a temporary nitrogen store.  Both enzymes are found in the same protein but have different active sites.  Both L-Asp and L-Arg must be present before either enzyme will display significant activity.
