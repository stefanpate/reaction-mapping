COMMENT - <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> has at least 32 genes with sequence similarity to known terpene synthase (TPS) genes |CITS: [12207221]|,
/each of which are expressed in one or more organs |CITS: [16297850]|. 
/Terpene synthase genes expressed predominantly in flowers have been further investigated for reactions catalyzed. 
/In flowers, &alpha;-chamigrene is produced from farnesyl diphosphate by the TPS encoded by AT5G44630|CITS: [15918888]|.
/
/Volatile terpenoids have been identified in floral emissions of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
/and associated with pollinator attraction |CITS: [11960742]|,
/which may serve to produce the limited amount of outcrossing which has been observed
/in this self-compatible species |CITS: [Abbott89]|. 
/However, production of floral volatile terpenes may serve other functions,
/such as protection against oxidative stress |CITS: [11743121]| or defense against pathogens |CITS: [10515903]|. 
/Alternatively, this may be a trait that has not yet been eliminated by drift or selection after <i>A. thaliana</i>
/diverged in this clade containing a number of related self-incompatible species |CITS: [11018155]|.
