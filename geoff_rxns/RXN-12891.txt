COMMENT - The enzyme specifically catalyses mono- or di-methylation (Ala, Ser or Pro) or tri-methylation (Ala or Ser) of the exposed &alpha;-amino group in the [Ala/Pro/Ser]-Pro-Lys motif. The protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae shows the highest activity towards the Pro-Pro-Lys-motif [1]. The Pro-Lys in positions 2-3 cannot be exchanged for other amino acids |CITS: [20481588][20668449]|.
