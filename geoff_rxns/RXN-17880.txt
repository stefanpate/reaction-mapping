COMMENT - Research indicates that a principal target of cellular NO is the thiol group of Cys in peptides and proteins |CITS: [15688001]|. In general, cysteine thiols (Cys-SH) can undergo a range of nitric oxide (NO)-dependent electrophilic and oxidative modifications as well as NO-independent oxidation by reactive oxygen species (ROS). These modifications consist of a progression from S-nitrosylation to sulfenic acid (SOH)/disulfide (SS), to sulfinic acid (SO2-), and irreversibly to sulfonic acid (SO3-).

/The exact mechanism of the reaction is not well known. It may proceed through the formation of a radical intermediate in the presence of an electron acceptor (for example, O2 reduced to superoxide, a nitrite radical reduced to nitrite, or NAD+ reduced to an NAD radical |CITS: [9006926]|. It has also been suggested that that cytochrome c is a mediator of S-nitrosation in biological systems |CITS: [19879353]|.
