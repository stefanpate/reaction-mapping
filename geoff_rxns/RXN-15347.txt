COMMENT - An <i>in vitro</i> reconstituted Sox system mediates not only |FRAME: S2O3|, but also |FRAME: SO3|-dependent cytochrome <i>c</i> reduction |CITS: [9260941][11443084]|. 
/While thiosulfate oxidation yields eight electrons, sulfite oxidation follows the following equation,
/and yields only 2 electrons per mol substrate:
/
/|FRAME:SO3| + |FRAME:WATER| = |FRAME:SULFATE| + 2|FRAME:E-| + 2|FRAME:PROTON|
/
/Sulfite oxidation does not require the presence of the SoxCD protein. The product of bisulfite binding to |FRAME: SoxZY-L-Cysteine| is proposed to be a sulfinate derivative as shown here |CITS: [24030319]|. SoxY-sulfinate could then serve as
/a substrate donor for an as-yet unknown sulfite transport system, releasing bisulfite inside the cytoplasm, which is then oxidized by |FRAME: CPLX-8835| via the reaction
