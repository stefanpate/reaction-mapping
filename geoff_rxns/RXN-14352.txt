COMMENT - Based on analysis of a hexokinase from spinach localized on the outer envelope membrane of the chloroplast, it is hypothesized that the |FRAME: Glucose| transported out of the chloroplast through this transport reaction is immediately phosphorylated to produce glucose-6-phosphate. This compound cannot passively diffuse or be re-imported back into the chloroplasts, thus a concentration gradient can be established to promote the transport of |FRAME: Glucose| out of the stroma and into the cytoplasm |CITS: [10561488]|.
