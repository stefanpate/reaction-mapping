COMMENT - This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of (1&rarr;4)-D-glucosidic linkages in xyloglucans so as to successively remove oligosaccharides from the chain end.
/
/The enzyme removes XXXG heptasaccharides, XXLG/XLXG octasaccharides and XLLG nonasaccharides from the end of tamarind seed xyloglucan polymers in a processive manner. Hydrolysis occurs at the unsubstituted D-glucopyranose residue in the main backbone. It is not known whether the cleavage takes place at the reducing or non-reducing end of the polymer. Very low activity with ?-D-glucans. The enzyme from Chrysosporium lucknowense shifts to an endoglucanase mode when acting on linear substrates without bulky substituents on the polymeric backbone such as barley ?-glucan.
