COMMENT - Isoflavone O-methylation is a key reaction for the formation of pterocarpan phytoalexins such as medicarpin. 
/Isoflavone specific O-methyltransferases have been purified expressing a high in vitro affinity for the methylation of 
/the A-ring 7-hydroxyl group of daidzein. 
/
/The resulting product, isoformononetin (7-O-methyldaidzein), is a rare naturally occurring compound which is unlikely
/to be involved in the formation of medicarpin. No products of the 7-O-methylation of daidzein have been demonstrated 
/to accumulate in elicited alfalfa cell cultures suggesting that this reaction may not occur <i>in vivo</i>. 
/
/Recently, a daidzein-7-O-methyltransferase (D7OMT) has been purified from <i>Glycyrrhiza echinata</i>. |CITS: [12610212]|
/The distinct biochemistry of D7OMT and the distant phylogenetic relationship to another O-methyltransferase 
/(2,7,4'-trihydroxyisoflavanone 4'-O-methyltransferase  - HI4'OMT)  acting specifically on 2,7,4'-trihydroxyisoflavanone 
/implies a new scheme of formonetin biosynthesis  which excludes the 4-O-methylation of daidzein.
