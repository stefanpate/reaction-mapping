COMMENT - A multimer (24-mer) of this enzyme forms the core of the multienzyme 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate dehydrogenase complex, and binds tightly both |FRAME: 1.2.4.4-RXN "EC 1.2.4.4, 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate dehydrogenase (2-methylpropanoyl-transferring)"| and |FRAME: 1.8.1.4-RXN "EC 1.8.1.4, dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase"|. The lipoyl group of this enzyme is reductively 2-methylpropanoylated by |FRAME: 1.2.4.4-RXN "EC 1.2.4.4"|, and the only observed direction catalysed by EC 2.3.1.168 is that where this 2-methylpropanoyl is passed to coenzyme A. In addition to the |FRAME: 2.3.1.168-RXN "2-methylpropanoyl"| group, formed when |FRAME: 1.2.4.4-RXN "EC 1.2.4.4"| acts on the oxoacid that corresponds with valine, this enzyme also transfers the |FRAME: ISOVALERYLCOA-DHLIPOAMIDE-RXN "3-methylbutanoyl"| and |FRAME: MBCOA-DHLIPOAMIDE-RXN "S-2-methylbutanoyl"| groups, donated to it when |FRAME: 1.2.4.4-RXN "EC 1.2.4.4"| acts on the oxo acids corresponding with leucine and isoleucine.
