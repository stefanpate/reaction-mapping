COMMENT - This <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knoevenagel_condensation">Knoevenagel condensation</A> occurs spontaneously, and has been verified experimentally. The authors suggested that it is unlikely that the reaction is catalyzed by an enzyme, although they could not exclude this possibility |CITS: [27865643]|.
