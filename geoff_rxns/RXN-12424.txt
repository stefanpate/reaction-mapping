COMMENT - This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of (1&rarr;4)-&beta;-D-galactosidic linkages in agarose, giving |FRAME: CPD-13434| as the predominant product. Also acts on (the agarose portions in the backbone of) |FRAME: Porphyrans porphyran|, but more slowly |CITS: [12970344]|. This enzyme cleaves the &beta;-(1&rarr;4) linkages of agarose in a random manner with retention of the anomeric-bond configuration, producing &beta;-anomers that give rise progressively to &alpha;-anomers when mutarotation takes place |CITS: [15456406]|. The end products of hydrolysis are |FRAME:CPD-13434| and |FRAME: CPD-13436| in the case of AgaA from the marine bacterium |FRAME: TAX-63186|, and |FRAME:CPD-13434| and |FRAME: CPD-13433| in the case of AgaB  |CITS: [15456406]|.
