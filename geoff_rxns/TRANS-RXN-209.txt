TYPES - Small-Molecule-Reactions
TYPES - TR-12
COMMON-NAME - Transport of triose phosphate
ATOM-MAPPINGS - :CPDS-LACK-STRUCTURE
COMMENT - This reaction is catalyzed by a transporter that is located on the chloroplastidic membrane and carries the transport of 
/phosphate and triose phosphate from within the chloroplast into the cytosol. The cellular location extracellular space will be 
/replaced with the appropriate term after the PO ontologies become available.
