COMMENT - Hydrolysis of (1->6)-&alpha;-D-glucosidic branch linkages in glycogen, amylopectin and their &beta;-limit
/dextrins.
/Also readily hydrolyses amylopectin. Differs from EC 3.2.1.41 (pullulanase) and EC 3.2.1.142
/(limit dextrinase) by its inability to hydrolyse pullulan, and by limited action on &alpha;-limit dextrins.
/Maltose is the smallest sugar it can release from an &alpha;-(1->6)-linkage.
