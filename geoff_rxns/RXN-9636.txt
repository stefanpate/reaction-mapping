COMMENT - A heme-thiolate protein (P-450). This enzyme catalyses two successive N-hydroxylations of L-isoleucine, the first committed steps in the biosynthesis of the cyanogenic glucoside lotaustralin in the plant Lotus japonicus. The product of the two hydroxylations, N,N-dihydroxy-L-isoleucine, is extremely labile and dehydrates spontaneously.The dehydrated product is then subject to a decarboxylation that produces the oxime. It is still not known whether the decarboxylation is spontaneous or catalysed by the enzyme. The product, (E)-2-methylbutanal oxime, undergoes a spontaneous isomerization to the (Z) form. The enzyme can also accept L-valine as substrate, with a lower activity. It is different from |FRAME: 1.14.13.118-RXN EC 1.14.13.118"| (valine N-monooxygenase), which prefers L-valine.
