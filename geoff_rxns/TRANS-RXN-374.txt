COMMENT - During some types of the C4 photosynthetic carbon assimilation cycle, the initial CO<sub>2</sub> fixation occurs in the mesophyll cells, producing |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID| that is subsequently converted to |FRAME: MAL|. Malate is transported into bundle sheath cells, where the CO<sub>2</sub> is released. This reaction aims to describe the transport of |FRAME: MAL| from the mesophyll cells to the bundle sheath cells.
