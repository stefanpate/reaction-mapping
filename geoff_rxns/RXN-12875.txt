COMMENT - In many plants |FRAME: L-THREONATE| yields |FRAME: TARTRATE| <i>in vivo</i> |CITS: [16662405]|. At this time nothing is known of the enzyme(s) catalyzing this four-electron oxidation.
/Theoretically, there could be two H2O2-generating oxidases, with |FRAME: CPD-13061| as intermediate |CITS: [15608627]|.
