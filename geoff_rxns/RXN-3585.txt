COMMENT - The malonylation of isoflavone glucosides has been suggested to be prerequisite for efficient passage of those 
/compounds through the tonoplast. Malonylation renders the isoflavone glucosides more water soluble, consequently 
/more suitable for vacuole storage. The malonylation step has been discussed as final step of the isoflavone conjugates
/biosynthesis |CITS: [6639051]|.  However, the isoflavone-7-O-glucoside 6"-malonate malonyltransferase activity 
/had been found strongly inhibited by distinct isoflavone-specific malonylesterase and glucohydrolase activities in 
/crude extracts of <i>Cicer arietinum</i> which rather points to the existence of an isoflavone conjugate cycle with a 
/subcellular compartmentation of the enzyme |CITS: [6497385]| .
