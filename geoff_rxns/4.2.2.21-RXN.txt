COMMENT - This reaction is defined as the exolytic cleavage of disaccharide residues from the non-reducing ends of both polymeric chondroitin sulfates and their oligosaccharide fragments.

/The enzyme degrades a variety of glycosaminoglycans of the |FRAME: Chondroitin-sulfates| and |FRAME: Dermatan-Sulfate| type.  Chondroitin sulfate, chondroitin-sulfate proteoglycan and dermatan sulfate are the best substrates but the enzyme can also act on |FRAME: Hyaluronan| at a much lower rate.  |FRAME: KERATAN-6-SULFATE "Keratan sulfate"|, |FRAME: Heparan-Sulfate| and |FRAME: HEPARIN| are not substrates.
/
/The related enzyme |FRAME: 4.2.2.5-RXN "EC 4.2.2.20"| has the same substrate specificity but produces a mixture of Delta(4)-unsaturated oligosaccharides of different sizes that are ultimately degraded to Delta(4)-unsaturated tetra- and disaccharides |CITS: [9083041]|. Both enzymes act by the removal of a relatively acidic C-5 proton of the uronic acid followed by the elimination of a 4-linked hexosamine, resulting in the formation of an unsaturated C4-C5 bond on the hexuronic acid moiety of the products |CITS: [9083041][18992215]|.
