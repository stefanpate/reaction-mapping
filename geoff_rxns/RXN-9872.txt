COMMENT - In UM-BBD, this reaction is given the EC number 1.14.12.10 , which however conflicts somewhat with the ENZYME db v.23.0, which shows that reaction as including the decarboxylation step. In UM-BBD, the pathway is drawn as if these are two separate steps, with a demonstratable intermediate compound.
