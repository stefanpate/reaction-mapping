UNIQUE-ID - RXN-14452
TYPES - Small-Molecule-Reactions
TYPES - Transport-Reactions
ATOM-MAPPINGS - :NON-INTEGER-STOICHIOMETRY
COMMENT - This is a special transport reaction, which does not occur on its own.  Instead, it can be used as a component for composing composite electron transport reactions, when there is a vectoral proton transport component.
