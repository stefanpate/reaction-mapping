COMMENT - 
/Selective cleavage after Arg<sub>223</sub> in complement component C2 (-Ser-Leu-Gly-Arg-|-Lys-Ile-Gln-Ile) and after Arg<sub>76</sub> in complement component C4 (-Gly-Leu-Gln-Arg-|-Ala-Leu-Glu-Ile).
/
/Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) recognizes patterns of neutral carbohydrates, such as mannose and N-acetylglucosamine, on a wide range of microbial surfaces and is able to initiate activation of the lectin pathway of complement |CITS: [15728497]|.
/This enzyme displays C1s-like esterolytic activity (cf. EC 3.4.21.42, complement subcomponent C1s). It also cleaves C4 and C2 with efficiencies that are relatively higher than those of EC 3.4.21.42 |CITS: [11527969]|. Belongs in peptidase family S1A.
