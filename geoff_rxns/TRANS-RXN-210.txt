TYPES - Small-Molecule-Reactions
TYPES - TR-12
COMMON-NAME - Transport of phopshoenolpyruvate
ATOM-MAPPINGS - :CPDS-LACK-STRUCTURE
COMMENT - This reaction is catalyzed by a transporter located on the chlorplasditic membrane, that enable the transport of phosphoenopyruvate 
/from within the cytosol to the plastid. The appropriate cellular compartment will be replaced after the plant ontologies become available.
