COMMENT - Requires FAD. A number of aldoses and ketoses in pyranose form, as well as glycosides, gluco-oligosaccharides, sucrose and lactose can act as a donor. 1,4-Benzoquinone or ferricenium ion (ferrocene oxidized by removal of one electron) can serve as acceptor. Unlike |FRAME: PYRANOSE-OXIDASE-RXN "EC 1.1.3.10, pyranose oxidase"|, this fungal enzyme does not interact with O<sub>2</sub> and exhibits extremely broad substrate tolerance with variable regioselectivity (C-3, C-2 or C-3 + C-2 or C-3 + C-4) for (di)oxidation of different sugars. |FRAME: D-Glucose| is exclusively or preferentially oxidized at C-3 (depending on the enzyme source), but can also be oxidized at C-2 + C-3. The enzyme also acts on 1->4-&alpha;- and 1->4-&beta;-gluco-oligosaccharides, non-reducing gluco-oligosaccharides and |FRAME: L-ARABINOSE|,
/which are not substrates of |FRAME: PYRANOSE-OXIDASE-RXN "EC 1.1.3.10"|. Sugars are oxidized in their pyranose but not in their furanose
/form.
