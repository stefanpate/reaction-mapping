COMMENT - Excision of the nucleobase lesion is a two-step process and involves formation of an enzyme-substrate Schiff base intermediate; subsequent DNA strand nicking occurs via a &beta;,&delta;-elimination leaving a 3'-terminal phosphate and a 5'-terminal phosphate. This reaction is catalysed by the Fpg (MutM) family of bifunctional DNA glycosylases.
