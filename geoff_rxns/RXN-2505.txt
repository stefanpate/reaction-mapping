CITATIONS - 8300532
COMMENT - This is a proposed reaction whereby 3-2-carboxyphenylcatechol (CPC) is transformed to
/2-hydroxy-6-(2-carboxyphenyl)-6-oxo-2,4-hexadienoate.
/CPC is the structural analog of 3-(2'-hydroxyphenyl)catechol and of 3-phenylcatechol, which are the effective
/ring fission substrates for the metapyrocatechases, in reactions that involve a dioxygen |CITS: [8300532]|.
