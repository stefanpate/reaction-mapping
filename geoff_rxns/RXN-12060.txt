COMMENT - The brain enzyme acts on 2',3'-cyclic AMP more rapidly than on the UMP or CMP derivatives. An enzyme from liver acts on 2',3'-cyclic CMP more rapidly than on the purine derivatives; it also hydrolyses the corresponding 3',5'-cyclic phosphates, but more slowly. This latter enzyme has been called cyclic-CMP phosphodiesterase.
