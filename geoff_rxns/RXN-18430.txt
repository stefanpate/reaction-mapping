COMMENT - |FRAME: HEME_A "Heme a"| is derived from |FRAME: HEME_O| by two successive hydroxylations. The first hydroxylation forms |FRAME: Heme_I|, the second hydroxylation results in an unstable dihydroxymethyl group, which spontaneously decomposes into a formyl group and a water molecule. However, while heme A synthase is strictly dependent on molecular oxygen, the source of the oxygen atom in |FRAME: HEME_A| was shown not to be molecular oxygen. It may be derived from water, but this has not been proven, and the mechanism for such a reaction is not understood |CITS: [15236569]|. In addition, it is still unknown how electrons enter the bacterial enzyme (both a thioredoxin-like protein and menaquinol have been suggested). For a review see |CITS: [22484221]|.
