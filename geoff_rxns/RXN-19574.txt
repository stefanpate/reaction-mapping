COMMENT - Hydrolysis of a &gamma;-glutamyl bond.
/
/A lysosomal or secreted, thiol-dependent peptidase, most active at acidic pH.
/Commonly studied with folylpoly-&gamma;-glutamate as substrate, with which the initial cleavage
/may release glutamate or poly-&gamma;-glutamate of two or more residues, according to the species
/of origin of the enzyme. Final products are pteroyl-&alpha;-glutamate (folic acid) and free glutamate.
/
/Highly specific for the &gamma;-glutamyl bond, but not for the C-terminal amino acid (leaving group).
/Action on &gamma;-glutamyl bonds is independent of an <i>N</i>-terminal pteroyl moiety, but it is
/not known whether an <i>N</i>-terminal &gamma;-Glu residue can be hydrolysed.
/Type example of peptidase family C26. Formerly EC 3.4.22.12
