COMMENT - The complete reaction equation has not been established. It is uncertain whether this reaction occurs spontaneously, or is enzymatically catalyzed |CITS: [19567870]|. It has been proposed that the analogous conversion of |FRAME: TETRA-H-BIOPTERIN| to |FRAME: CPD0-1718| occurs via nonenzymatic side chain release |CITS: [5543324][5809723]|.
