COMMENT - A pyridoxal-phosphate protein. The sulfur from free L-cysteine is first transferred to a cysteine residue in the active site, and then passed on to various other acceptors. The enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters, thio-nucleosides in tRNA, thiamine, biotin, lipoate and pyranopterin (molybdopterin) |CITS: [12382038]|. In Azotobacter vinelandii, this sulfur provides the inorganic sulfide required for nitrogenous metallocluster formation |CITS: [8464885]|.
