COMMENT - There are at least three classes of hydrogenases that have different metallic centers, different catalytic properties, and different propensities to consume or produce hydrogen under physiological conditions.
/The iron [Fe] hydrogenases described in this class of protein have a [4Fe4S] cluster connected through a cysteinyl ligand to a binuclear [2Fe] center, known as the H-cluster, and they tend to produce, rather than consume hydrogen |CITS: [15082711]|. Like many complex metalloproteins, they require specific factors to facilitate the assembly and insertion of metal clusters in order to become active |CITS: [15082711]|. Their activation may also depend upon proteolytic processing 
/|CITS: [8513797]|. Any process required for the activation of iron hydrogenases can be represented by this reaction.
