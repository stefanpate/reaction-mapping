COMMENT - The 3',5'-dihydroxyflavanone is formed via the 3'-hydroxyflavanone.  In Petunia hybrida the enzyme acts on naringenin, eriodictyol, dihydroquercetin (taxifolin) and dihydrokaempferol (aromadendrin).  The enzyme catalyzes the hydroxylation of 5,7,4'-trihydroxyflavanone (naringenin) at either the 3' position to form eriodictyol or at both the 3' and 5' positions to form 5,7,3',4',5'-pentahydroxyflavanone (dihydrotricetin).  The enzyme also catalyzes the hydroxylation of 3,5,7,3',4'-pentahydroxyflavanone (taxifolin) at the 5' position, forming ampelopsin.  NADH is not a good substitute for NADPH.
