COMMENT - A flavoprotein (FAD). A component of the multienzyme 2-oxo-acid dehydrogenase complexes. In the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, it binds to the core of |FRAME: RXN0-1133 "EC 2.3.1.12, dihydrolipoyllysine-residue acetyltransferase"|, and catalyses oxidation of its dihydrolipoyl groups. It plays a similar role in the oxoglutarate and 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate dehydrogenase complexes. Another substrate is the dihydrolipoyl group in the H-protein of the glycine-cleavage system (click <A href="http://www.enzyme-database.org/reaction/AminoAcid/GlyCleave.html">here</A> for diagram), in which it acts, together with |FRAME: GCVP-RXN "EC 1.4.4.2, glycine dehydrogenase (decarboxylating)"|, and |FRAME: GCVT-RXN "EC 2.1.2.10, aminomethyltransferase"|, to break down glycine. It can also use free dihydrolipoate, dihydrolipoamide or dihydrolipoyllysine as substrate. This enzyme was first shown to catalyse the oxidation of NADH by methylene blue; this activity was called diaphorase. The glycine cleavage system is composed of four components that only loosely associate: the P protein (|FRAME: GCVP-RXN "EC 1.4.4.2"|), the T protein (|FRAME: GCVT-RXN "EC 2.1.2.10"|), the L protein (|FRAME: 1.8.1.4-RXN "EC 1.8.1.4"|) and the lipoyl-bearing H protein |CITS: [15642479]|.
